          Korean Dalgona Coffee Recipe – How to Whip Up This Viral Drink

          <h2>What is Korean Dalgona Coffee?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Dalgona coffee is a unique beverage made with
              <strong>milk and hand-whipped coffee</strong>, creating a
              luxuriously creamy and frothy drink. It switches up the usual
              cappuccino, as the coffee is frothed and layered over hot or cold
              milk instead of the other way around.

            />
            <p>
              While the recipe was first created by the Macanese coffee shop
              owner Leong Kam Hon in 2004, it went viral during the pandemic
              with the Korean name Dalgona, which also refers to the Korean
              honeycomb toffee. It’s the same one you see in the Netflix show
              Squid Game. The whipped coffee drink reminded actor Jung Il-woo of
              dalgona in terms of taste and appearance, which is what led to it
              being called “dalgona coffee” even though the actual dalgona candy
              is not an ingredient. Go figure…
              <br />
              <br />
              Much like everyone else, I discovered this interesting drink while
              scrolling on social media. I tried whipping up my own Dalgona
              coffee and it turned out great. Whenever I crave a dessert-like
              brew, I make this delicious drink. I also get a lot of complements
              from friends when I make this for them.

          <h2>Ingredients and Equipment for Making Dalgona Coffee</h2>
          <p>
            Here are the things you need to make 2 servings of Dalgona coffee:
          </p>
          <div class="ingredient-list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Whisk or handheld frother:</b> Use this to create a foamy
                coffee mixture that goes on top of the Dalgona coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>2 tbsp instant coffee:</b> Provides a quick and convenient
                way to prepare the coffee foam.
              </li>
              <li><b>2 tbsp sugar:</b> Adds sweetness to the coffee foam.</li>
              <li>
                <b>2 tbsp hot water:</b> The water dissolves the coffee and
                sugar before being turned into foam.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>400 ml milk:</b> Serves as the base for the drink, giving it
                a smooth texture.
              </li>
              <li><b>Ice:</b> Added to cool the final drink.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            As you can see, the ration of 2-2-2 of coffee-sugar-water are easy
            to remember. This is a volumetric recipe, so it is not based on
            weight.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Caffeine Warning:</b> There is a lot of caffeine in 2 tablespoons
            of instant coffee! If you were to use this for one serving of
            dalgona coffee, it would be the equivalent to 3.5 cups of regular
            coffee. So it’s best treated as an occasional indulgent treat rather
            than a daily beverage, or split it with a friend and use it for 2
            servings. I always get caffeine jitters when I have this drink.
          </p>

          <h2>Step-by-Step Guide on How to Make Dalgona Coffee</h2>
          <p class="step-desc">
            The simplicity and speed of crafting Dalgona coffee are part of its
            charm. Follow the steps below to make this popular beverage:
          </p>
          <div>
            <p class="steps">
              1. In a bowl, combine the sugar, coffee, and hot water.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bring together the equal parts sugar, instant coffee, and hot
                water in a bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mix until the dry ingredients are dissolved and you have a dark
                coffee mixture.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="steps">
              2. <i>Whisk the mixture until it becomes foamy.</i>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Take your whisk or a handheld frother and froth the mixture.
              </li>
              <li>It should turn light brown with soft peaks formed.</li>
              <li>
                My arms turn to jelly if I use a hand whisk, so I would
                recommend you use an electric one.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="steps">3. Add ice and milk to a glass.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prepare your glass where the final drink will be served.</li>
              <li>Pour your ice and milk into the glass.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="steps">4. Layer the coffee foam over the milk.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Carefully pour the frothy coffee mixture into the glass. The
                layers of white milk and the brown coffee foam create a tempting
                sight.
              </li>
              <li>Serve your Dalgona coffee and enjoy!</li>
            </ul>

              What kind of cup should I serve a Dalgona coffee in?
            </p>
            <p>
              Use a mug or tall glass that can accommodate about 18 oz for the
              drink, while leaving room for both the ice and whipped cream on
              top.
