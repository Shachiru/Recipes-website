              Irish coffee is a coffee cocktail made by
              <strong
                >combining brewed coffee, Irish whiskey, sugar, and whipped
                cream.</strong
              >
              This makes a pretty interesting fusion featuring the kick of
              coffee, the buzz of whiskey, the creaminess of whipped cream, and
              a hint of sweetness from the sugar.

              Its story goes back to the 1940s at the Foynes Port maritime
              airport in Ireland, where
              <strong>Chef Joe Sheridan served it to travelers.</strong> This
              was back in the early days of flying, when float planes would land
              on the water and cold, shivering passengers were brought ashore by
              boat. To warm them up, Sheridan created the now world famous Irish
              coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Irish friend recommended it to me in my 20s (quite a long time
              ago…) when we were drinking at a pub, and it was great. He also
              said he makes it at home all the time, and it’s as easy as you can
              get in the world of cocktails.

          <h2>Equipment and Ingredients for Irish Coffee</h2>
          <p>Here’s everything you need to make this Irish coffee:</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Shaker or jar with lid:</strong>
                Adds air to the cream, which makes it easier to float on top of
                the coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strainer:</strong> Removes bubbles from shaking the
                cream.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Spoon:</strong> Floats the cream on top of the coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hot water:</strong>
                Use this to preheat the glass.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>120ml brewed coffee:</strong>
                Choose a strong coffee for this coffee cocktail.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>30ml whiskey:</strong>
                You can use single malt or blended whiskey for this recipe.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>10g sugar:</strong>
                This equals to about 1 tablespoon, and it balances out the
                strong tastes of the other ingredients.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>30ml whipping cream:</strong>
                Choose a cream with a fat content of about 30%.
              </li>
            </ul>

              1. <i>Preheat the glass.</i>
            </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Pour hot water into the glass for preheating.</li>

                  Using your chosen brewer, make 120ml of strong brewed coffee.
                  I make mine with the AeroPress, but you can also use a French
                  press, Moka pot, and pour-over.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Discard the preheating water then pour the coffee into the
                  empty glass.
                </li>
