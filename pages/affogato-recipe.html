          Affogato Recipe – Make an Ice Cream & Espresso Treat

          <h2>What is an Affogato?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Affogato is an Italian dessert that
              <b>combines espresso and plain ice cream or gelato.</b> The
              Italian name of this caffeinated treat translates to “drowned”,
              which refers to the way the iced dessert is being drowned with
              coffee
            </p>

              While the story of its invention is a bit murky, the
              <strong
                >Affogato gained popularity in Italy during the 1950s,</strong
              >
              the same time that the ice cream industry was being modernized.

            <p>
              I first stumbled upon this dessert while at an Italian restaurant
              years ago, and it’s the simplicity that charmed me. I never bought
              plain vanilla ice cream back then, but since I discovered the
              Affogato, it is sure to be found in our fridge during summer.

          <h2>Ingredients and Equipment for Making Affogato</h2>
          <p>Here are the things that you will need to make an Affogato:</p>
          <div class="ingredient-list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>2 shots of espresso:</strong> a key ingredient for this
                dessert, the espresso creates a strong and rich coffee base to
                complement the gelato. You can get away with using faux-espresso
                here, since the ice cream alters the taste of the espresso.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>2 scoops of plain ice cream or gelato:</strong> the
                other half of this simple but delicious treat. It’s best to use
                vanilla or milk flavors for this recipe.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Toppings (optional):</strong>
                Toppings (optional): to add more flavor or texture to your
                affogato. Coffee shavings, chocolate syrup, caramel, and
                pistachios are some of the toppings to consider.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ice cream scooper: </strong>use this to make two scoops
                of ice cream or gelato. A spoon can be used but thinner ice
                cream scoops can melt much faster.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>Step-by-Step Guide on How to Make an Affogato</h2>
          <p class="step-desc">
            Making an Affogato is very easy, especially if you already know how
            to make an espresso. Just follow these steps:
          </p>
          <div>
            <p class="steps">
              1. Put two scoops of ice cream or gelato in a cup.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Take two scoops of your plain ice cream or gelato and put them
                in a cup.
              </li>
              <li>
                An authentic Italian affogato uses gelato with no toppings so if
                you’re making one, you can skip to step 3.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="steps">2. Add your desired topping.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Shave some chocolate, sprinkle some pistachios, or drizzle some
                chocolate syrup or caramel on top of the ice cream.
              </li>
              <li>
                I recommend not to overdo this so you can still enjoy the
                interesting blend of ice cream and espresso.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="steps">3. Pull a double shot of espresso.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Using your espresso machine, pull a double shot of espresso into
                a separate espresso cup. If you need help, you can check my
                espresso recipe.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you don’t have access to an espresso machine, you can also
                use other methods to create espresso-like coffee with brewers
                such as the Moka pot, AeroPress, and French press.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="steps">
              4. Pour the espresso over the ice cream or gelato.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Now it’s time to “drown” your iced dessert. Pour your double
                espresso into the cup where your ice cream or gelato is.
              </li>
              <li>Serve with a spoon and enjoy your Affogato!</li>
