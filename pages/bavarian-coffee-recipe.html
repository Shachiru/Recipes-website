              <p>
                Bavarian coffee is a combination of
                <b
                  >strong coffee, peppermint schnapps, Kahlua, milk, and whipped
                  cream.</b
                >
                It’s a sweet drink that deliciously blends the bold flavors of
                coffee, the sweetness of peppermint schnapps and Kahlua, and the
                creaminess of whipped cream. <br /><br />
                So where did it get its name from? Bavaria is a large state in
                Germany where the Zugspitze mountain, the country’s highest
                peak, is located. No wonder a warming brew will originate from
                such a state.
                <br /><br />
                I’ve never actually had Bavarian coffee in Germany, my first
                encounter with it was at a cafe in Vienna. Having tried a couple
                of coffee cocktails such as the Amaretto and Corretto before, I
                gave it a “shot”. It was a pleasant surprise as
                <b>it took the sweetness and creaminess up a notch</b>, and that
                slight peppermint flavor makes it even more interesting.
                <br /><br />
                I like sipping on this drink during winter nights, it’s my go-to
                coffee cocktail next to the Espresso Martini.

            <h2>Ingredients and Equipment for Bavarian Coffee</h2>
            <p>
              Here are the things that you will need to make Bavarian coffee:
            </p>
            <div
              style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px; line-height: 1.8"

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>120 ml strong brewed coffee:</b> It’s up to you how you
                  want to make your black coffee. Most people prefer using a
                  drip coffee machine for quick and convenient brewing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>15 ml Kahlua:</b> A blend of coffee and rum that goes well
                  in loads of coffee cocktails. You can buy one or just make
                  your own Kahlua at home.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>15 ml Peppermint schnapps:</b> This strong spirit tastes
                  like peppermint candy, which gives a distinct sweetness to the
                  coffee cocktail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>30 ml Half and half:</b> This combination of milk and cream
                  gives the Bavarian coffee a more mellow taste and a slightly
                  thicker texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>1 tsp sugar (optional):</b> Gives the beverage a sweeter
                  taste if you prefer it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Whipped cream:</b> A dollop of whipped cream on top adds
                  indulgence to the final drink.
                </li>
              </ul>
