              Mexico’s Cafe de Olla is a
              <b
                >caffeinated beverage composed of coffee, spices, and piloncillo
              </b>
              or unrefined cane sugar. In Mexican kitchens, this drink is
              traditionally brewed using an earthen clay pot called olla de
              barro, which adds an earthy touch to the final concoction.

            <p>
              Like the Americano, this recipe was invented during the war,
              specifically the Mexican Revolution where it warmed and perked up
              soldiers.
              <br />
              <br />
              I first encountered the Cafe de Olla at a Mexican restaurant. I
              was craving my cup of coffee and they recommended their authentic
              Cafe de Olla. Since I also enjoy spices in my coffee, it was a
              pleasant experience. I then started replicating the flavorful brew
              at home.

          <h2>Ingredients and Equipment for Making Cafe De Olla</h2>
          <p>
            Here are the things that you will need to make your Cafe De Olla:
          </p>
          <div style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Saucepan with lid:</b> This serves as the brewer for the Cafe
                De Olla. You can also use an Olla De Barro, an Earthen clay pot
                traditionally used for making this coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Strainer and cheesecloth:</b> Used to remove the impurities
                from the final coffee drink.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>6 cups water:</b> The water serves as the base for brewing
                the coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>5 oz Piloncillo:</b>
                Piloncillo is an unrefined cane sugar commonly used in Latin
                American cuisine. It sweetens the coffee while giving it a
                distinct taste. You can also use unrefined brown sugar.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>2 cinnamon sticks:</b> Cinnamon adds warmth and spiciness to
                the coffee, complementing its flavor profile.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>2 whole cloves:</b> Cloves contribute a subtle earthy and
                slightly sweet taste to the coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>1 pc star anise:</b> Star anise enhances the aroma and
                imparts a licorice-like flavor to the coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>6 tablespoons medium-coarse ground coffee:</b> Dark roasts
                work best for this recipe. You want to use as many tablespoons
                of coffee, as cups of water you’re adding.
              </li>

                  Add an 8 oz Piloncillo to the pot. Adjust the size if you

                  Also add the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and star anise.
