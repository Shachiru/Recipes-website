          How to Make A Real Frappé – The Authentic Greek Iced Coffee Recipe

          <h2>What is a Frappé?</h2>

            <p>
              The Frappé is an iced coffee drink made with
              <b
                >instant coffee, cold water, and sugar which are shaken or
                whisked together to create a foamy consistency</b
              >
              before ice and milk are added to the mix.
              <br /><br />It has been around since the mid-19th century, but
              back then Frappé was used to refer to a variety of iced coffee
              drinks. Even today, the term could mean different beverages
              depending on the country, with some serving it ice-blended with a
              slushy consistency, similar to the Frappuccino line of Starbucks.
              <br /><br />However, the modern version of the Frappé really
              kicked off in 1957 during the Thessaloniki International Fair in
              Greece. When Nestlé was going to introduce an iced chocolate drink
              made with a shaker, an employee named Dimitris Vakondios who
              couldn’t find hot water for his coffee used the method with his
              coffee granules, accidentally inventing the Frappé!
              <br /><br />With its
              <b>interesting origin, simplicity, and rich texture</b> to go with
              the delicious coffee, the Frappé might just become one of your
              go-to coffee drinks to cool you down in the summer.

          <h2>Ingredients and Equipment for Making Frappé</h2>
          <p>Making a Frappé is really simple, you just need a few things:</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Handheld frother or shaker:</b> This gives the Frappé its
                rich texture, setting it apart from the typical iced coffee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>1 tbsp instant coffee:</b> Creates the coffee base for your
                Frappé.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>1 tbsp brown sugar:</b> Provides sweetness that complements
                the foamy coffee drink.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>100 ml cold water:</b> Used to dissolve the instant coffee.
                It dissolves slower in cold water, but the frother or shaker
                will speed things up.
              </li>
              <li><b>50 ml milk:</b> A splash of milk adds creaminess.</li>
              <li><b>Ice:</b> Added to complete the chilled drink.</li>

          <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Frappé</h2>
          <p>
            Making a Frappé is as easy as making an iced coffee. Instead of hot
            water, you simply use cold water and add frothing or shaking to the
            process. Here are the steps to crafting a cup of Frappé:
          </p>
          <div>
            <p
              style="
                font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
                font-size: 25px;
              "
            >
              1. <i>Combine instant coffee, sugar, and water.</i>
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Add your instant coffee, sugar, and water to a cup.</li>
                <li>
                  If you’re shaking the mixture, use your shaker instead of a
                  cup.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p
              style="
                font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
                font-size: 25px;
              "
            >
              2. <i>Froth the mixture.</i>
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Start shaking the mixture or use the handheld frother to froth
                  it until smooth and foamy.
                </li>
                <li>The thicker the froth, the better.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p
              style="
                font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
                font-size: 25px;
              "
            >
              3. <i>Pour the milk.</i>
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Once your frothed coffee is in the cup, slowly pour the milk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should see the foam rise and remain on top of the drink.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p
              style="
                font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
                font-size: 25px;
              "
            >
              4. <i>Add some ice and serve.</i>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add some ice cubes and let them sink into the foam.</li>
              <li>Serve and enjoy your Frappé!</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p
            style="
              font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
              font-size: 25px;
            "

            What kind of cup should a Frappé be served in?
          </p>
          <p>
            A Frappé is often served in a large transparent glass, enough to
            make room for the foam and ice cubes. It should also be consumed
            using a straw to avoid causing any mess as you drink your foamy
            Frappé.
